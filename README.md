### Description
Fun little side project. A basic weather app. Displays current and future information for a city which can be searched. The page remembers the most recent search and loads that city on page load. Designed specifically for mobile devices, but works well in a regular computer browser as well. I was hoping to have a search history, but havenâ€™t gotten around to it yet. The API is not great, and the search functionality is less than I would like. Lot of room for improvements, but for a basic little project, it turned out alright.
